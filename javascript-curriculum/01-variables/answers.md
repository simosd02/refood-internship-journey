# Task 3: Reassign Values
When we try to reassign a const variable, we see an error because the const variable does not crash anymore, because it is constant and incrasable.

# ● What’s the difference between var, let, and const?
var : Old way. Function-scoped. Can be changed and re-declared.
let : Newer. Block-scoped. Can be changed, but not re-declared.
const : Newer. Block-scoped. Can't be changed or re-declared.

# ● When should we use const over let?
Use const when the value shouldn't change, and use let when the value will change later.

# ● Why should we avoid using var in modern JavaScript?
